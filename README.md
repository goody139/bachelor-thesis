# bachelor-thesis
This is the repository for the thesis ["Timing distributions of sequence elements for dendritic sequence processing"](./Thesis/Thesis_lgolla.pdf). 
It contains code for the experimental setup, Plotting Code, Modeling of Dendritic Branches and a naive classifier and all figures used in the thesis. The data of the results were too large to add them to Github so I uploaded them publicly available on [myshare](https://myshare.uni-osnabrueck.de/d/cdfafc7ce1b44167b049/).

The following image provides an overview of the designed system. For a detailed description and theoretical background of the individual components, refer the [thesis](./filepath/Thesis_Final_Digital.pdf), and see the [receiver code](code/csi_receiver/) for the implementation.
